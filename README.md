# OmniEats
Why waste time searching for food reviews? OmniEats provides them all!

# What does OmniEats do?
Search multiple databases of restaurants, list reviews from each source, and calculate a meta-rating (we'll call it OmniRating).

# How does it do it?
The webpage is written in HTML, CSS, and JS.
We found and organized datasets from four different apps and retrieved restaurant names and ratings from them.

# Why did we make OmniEats?
Finding good food should be fast, easy, and convenient. We hope OE (OmniEats) fulfill this mission.

The idea is similar to the google search results for a movie.
On the results page, the sidebar has the ratings for the movie by Rotten Tomatoes AND IMDb.
Getting more information at the same time is far more efficient than having to visit multiple sites.
